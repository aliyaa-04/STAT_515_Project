### About Me

Hello Everyone! I am Aliya Parvez Shaikh, and I am a data analytics engineering graduate student at here George Mason University. I have previously completed my bachelors in Computer Science from the German University of Technology in Oman and during my undergraduate degree, I was intrigued with data. The power even a single data point holds, to make or break a pattern. The ability to delve deep into data, discover hidden patterns in a sea of numbers and make discoveries excited me. I have previously worked on creating a study tool to help discover dyslexia among children using machine learning tools. I have also worked on a dataset to understand about the emissions of the petroleum industry in US.
