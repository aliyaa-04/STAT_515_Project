## 

#### Hello everyone, and welcome to our STAT-515 Final Project website! {style="blue"}

In this project, we will explore how key health indicators such as BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol and HbA1c levels can relate to diabetes risk and a broader metabolic health in U.S adults using the NHANES 2021–2023 dataset.

### Project Overview

-   Analyze demographic and clinical variables using summary statistics and visualizations  

-   Use logistic regression to identify predictors of diabetes  

-   Classify individuals into high vs. low metabolic risk groups  

-   Build and evaluate models to understand health patterns
